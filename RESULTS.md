Team opinion:

- **Documentation quality:** really nice, with live playground for every option
- **Ease of use:** easy to setup and configure for most cases 
- **Customisation capabilities (features & styling):** many options, and allows passing custom elements for tooltips etc. but if you need something else, then it might be impossible to implement. Css styles can be added to only certain elements. 
- **Features that might be hard to implement:**
  - sizing of the chart can be defined only in absolute pixel values making it hard to adjust based on screen size etc.
  - we haven't found support for custom animations
